This folder contains all the data cleaning notebooks.

To run them, open the notebook in collab, upload the raw data, and run the whole code.

Note regarding temperature: we cleaned each month separately but with the same code. So you have to upload each month after the other.

Note regarding precipitation: the cleaning of precipitation took place in two steps due to the format of the dataset (the only one not from FAOSTAT). Hence, the raw data first needs to be run on the cleaning_1 and afterwards on the cleaning_2. And again, we cleaned each month separately but with the same code. So you have to upload each month after the other.
