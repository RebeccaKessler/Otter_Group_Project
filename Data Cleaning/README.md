This folder contains all the data cleaning notebooks.

To run them, open the notebook in collab, upload the raw data, and run the whole code.

Note regarding temperature: we cleaned each month separately but with the same code. So you have to upload each month after the other.

Note regarding precipitation: we cleaned each month separately but with the same code. So you have to upload each month after the other. Additionally, we calculated the variation or "anomaliy" for temperature. for this we have a separate notebook labelled accordingly.
